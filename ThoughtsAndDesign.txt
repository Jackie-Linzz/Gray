         Thoughts and Design

  As for now, My favorite language is C++, but it is too complex. Scheme is the most elegant language I have ever seen, but it is not industrial. Python is like glue and it is easy to use, but it is too slow. CLOS is a powerful object system, but its syntax is not that natural. I haven't used go and julia. Maybe I would have a try sometime. So basically, none of the existing programming language can make me satisfied.
  

Features:

1. Gray supports multiple programming paradiam. It supports procedure-oriented programming, object-oriented programming, generic programming.

2. code is the same as data. It can also be manipulated.

3. It support garbage collection. It is an option. User can enable it or disable it.

4. User can program on two layers. The upper layer focuses on elegance. The lower layer focuses on performance.

5. The template syntax in C++ looks kind of ugly. Better find an elegant way.

6. Its core stays at a minimum. It can be extended easily. (optional)

7. It could be both static and dynamic. (optional)
